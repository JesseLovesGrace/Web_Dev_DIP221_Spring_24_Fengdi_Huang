    <p>Here what you see is a Lorem. This is only for when you don't have the content yet, later you can replace them with your own content</p>
    <p>Now is Feb 21st 2024. I have linked my GitHub repository to my local environment(is it called this?). I am testing if I am able to modify the code locally and sync the changes</p>
    <p>Update: This is 15 minutes later. This is very similar with codespace. If you want to commit the changes, don't forget to [git config --global user.name "Your_User_Name"] and [git config --global user.email "Your_Email"]</p>
    <p>And I am still working on understanding how it works......so......But so far so good :P</p>
